# Meeting Scheduling System

This project is a simple meeting scheduling system that allows a user to schedule a meeting with one or more people, and checks for time and room availability.

The system has two implementations:

1 Basic Implementation for one person (P1).

The basic implementation of the system allows a user to schedule a meeting with the following inputs:

Date
Start time and End time (or a time slot)
Room ID from a fixed set: (R1, R2, R3, R4, R5)
The system checks for any time collisions when scheduling a new meeting.

2 Advanced Implementation for multiple people (P1, P2, P3, P4, P5)

The advanced implementation of the system allows a user to schedule a meeting with one or more people. The inputs for scheduling a meeting include:

Date
Start time and End time (or a time slot)
Room ID from a fixed set: (R1, R2, R3, R4, R5)
Other person(s) in meeting as a parameter in a comma-separated form.
The system checks for the availability of other people during the scheduled time slot, and also checks for any time and room collisions.
